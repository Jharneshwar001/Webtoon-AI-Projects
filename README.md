# Webtoon-AI-Projects
This repository contains a collection of AI projects focused on webtoon data analysis and automation. The projects demonstrate foundational AI skills through the development of simple models and algorithms using Python. The following tasks are included:

Content Classifier: A simple content classification model that categorizes webtoon descriptions into genres such as romance, action, and fantasy. This model utilizes a small dataset of webtoon descriptions and implements a decision tree or logistic regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library.

Sentiment Analysis: A basic sentiment analysis tool that evaluates user comments on the topic "The Difference Between Manga And Manhwa." This task employs a rule-based approach or the TextBlob library to classify comments as positive or negative, providing insights into user sentiment with a summary of the results.

Chatbot Development: A basic chatbot designed to answer common questions about "Castle Swimmer." Utilizing Python and the NLTK library, the chatbot responds to inquiries regarding the webtoonâ€™s plot and main characters, employing keyword recognition for simple interactions.
